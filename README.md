A hands-on DevOps lab space I'm building to **learn by doing** and document my journey through real-world tools and workflows.

This is not a tutorial repo — it's a **personal portfolio**, built incrementally as I experiment with and solidify concepts in **DevOps, SRE, and infrastructure automation**.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Practiced
- Declarative infrastructure
- CI/CD workflows
- Container orchestration
- Infra provisioning (local + cloud)
- Automation via scripting



### 🧰 Tools I'm Exploring Hands-on
- Vagrant, Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/K3s)
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- Ansible, Terraform
- Bash, Python



### 🗺️ Lab Design Philosophy
- Modular & self-contained labs
- Local-first development
- Prefer simple over complex
- Built to learn, not to ship
