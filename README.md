A hands-on DevOps lab space I'm building to **learn by doing** and document my journey through real-world tools and workflows.

This is not a tutorial repo — it's a **personal portfolio**, built incrementally as I experiment with and solidify concepts in **DevOps, SRE, and infrastructure automation**.
