# 🧪 DevOps Labs

This is a personal DevOps lab collection I’m building to **enhance my skills through hands-on practice**.  
It contains modular setups for tools and workflows like **CI/CD, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform**, and more — most of which run locally using **Vagrant**, **Docker**, or **minikube**.

Whether it’s setting up Jenkins pipelines, launching a k8s cluster, or testing IaC with Terraform — this repo serves as my **learning playground** to explore DevOps concepts practically.
