Practicing real-world DevOps projects with hands-on implementations of **CI/CD**, **containerization**, **orchestration**, **monitoring**, and **infrastructure as code (IaC)**.

This repository is a collection of practical DevOps setups built to simulate real-world workflows, automate infrastructure, and demonstrate end-to-end deployment pipelines.

### üß† Core Concepts Practiced

- Declarative Infrastructure
- CI/CD Workflows
- Container Orchestration
