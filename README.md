Practicing real-world DevOps projects with hands-on implementations of **CI/CD**, **Containerization**, **Orchestration**, **Monitoring**, and **Infrastructure As Code (IaC)**.

This repository is a collection of practical DevOps setups built to simulate real-world workflows, automate infrastructure, and demonstrate end-to-end deployment pipelines.

---

### üß† Core Concepts Practiced

- Declarative Infrastructure
- CI/CD Workflows
- Container Orchestration
- Infrastructure Provisioning (Local + Cloud)
- Automation via Scripting


### üß∞ Tools I'm Exploring Hands-On

- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube / K3s), Helm
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLabCI, ArgoCD
- **IaC & Automation**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Scripting**: Bash, Python
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus
