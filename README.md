Practicing real-world DevOps projects with hands-on implementations of **CI/CD**, **containerization**, **orchestration**, **monitoring**, and **infrastructure as code (IaC)**.

This repository is a collection of practical DevOps setups built to simulate real-world workflows, automate infrastructure, and demonstrate end-to-end deployment pipelines.

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts Practiced

- Declarative Infrastructure
- CI/CD Workflows
- Container Orchestration
- Infrastructure Provisioning (Local + Cloud)
- Automation via Scripting


### 🧰 Tools I'm Exploring Hands-On

- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube / K3s), Helm
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **IaC & Automation**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Scripting**: Bash, Python
