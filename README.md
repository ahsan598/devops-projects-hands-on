# 🧪 DevOps Labs

This is a personal DevOps lab collection to **build and reinforce my skills via hands-on practice**.  
It’s a modular playground for tools and workflows like **CI/CD, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform**, and more — running mostly local using **Vagrant**, **Docker**, or **Minikube**.


Most labs are designed to run **locally**, without needing cloud accounts — unless explicitly stated (like `aws-labs/`).
