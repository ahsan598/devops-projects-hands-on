# üåê AWS Aurora MySQL Database Setup

This lab sets up a **highly available Aurora MySQL cluster** within a **custom VPC architecture** in AWS using manual configuration (AWS Console). It's part of my DevOps learning journey, focusing on understanding cloud networking, security, and managed database services.

### üß± Resources Provisioned

The following components are created in this setup:

- Amazon **VPC** with public and private subnets (across all selected AZs)
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)** and **NAT Gateways** for internet access
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)** for traffic control across AZs
- Multiple **VPC Security Groups**
- **Linux bastion host** in public subnet for SSH access
- **Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster** in private subnet
- **Aurora DB Replica** in a different AZ for high availability


### Project Architecture:

> **Deployment uses the AWS Console** via a guided Quick Start.

![Project Diagram](https://github.com/ahsan598/aws-project-1/blob/main/amazon-aurora-db-in-aws.svg)


**This architecture provisions:**

- A fully isolated VPC with public/private subnet pairs across AZs
- Private subnets for Aurora DB instances (multi-AZ setup)
- Public subnet hosting a **bastion host** for secure SSH into private resources
- NAT gateways enabling internet access from private subnets
- Aurora cluster with writer + reader DB instances

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Notes (Manual - AWS Console)

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step overview of how this setup was created:

1. **Create a VPC**
   - Use VPC Wizard or custom configuration
   - Include at least 2 public + 2 private subnets across different AZs

2. **Add Internet Gateway and route tables**
   - Attach IGW to VPC
   - Configure route tables for public subnets

3. **Create NAT Gateways**
   - One in each AZ for high availability
   - Allocate Elastic IPs for each

4. **Configure NACLs**
   - Allow required inbound/outbound rules for your subnets

5. **Launch Bastion Host**
   - Place in a public subnet
   - Associate a security group allowing SSH (port 22)

6. **Launch Aurora MySQL Cluster**
   - Choose "Amazon Aurora (MySQL-Compatible Edition)"
   - Place in private subnets only
   - Create a writer + replica instance (different AZs)
   - Use a new security group for DB (internal traffic only)

7. **Test Connectivity**
   - SSH into Bastion Host
   - Create an SSH tunnel to forward local port to Aurora DB endpoint


### üß™ Testing the Deployment

To confirm that the Aurora MySQL DB is accepting connections:

1. SSH into the **bastion host** and set up **port forwarding**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Bastion-IP> -L 3306:<Aurora-Endpoint>:3306
   ```
2. Launch **MySQL Workbench** on your local machine.
3. Go to `Database > Connect to Database`.
4. Enter the following:
    - **Hostname**: `127.0.0.1`
    - **Port**: `3306` (or your forwarded port)
    - **Username**: Your `DBMasterUsername`
    - **Password**: Value entered during Aurora setup
5. Once connected, you‚Äôll see the MySQL Workbench dashboard.
6. After testing, **terminate the SSH tunnel** using `Ctrl + C`

‚úÖ Deployment verified!

### üìå Notes

- This setup was created manually to understand VPC-level networking and DB security zones.
- In future, this same setup can be automated using Terraform or AWS CLI for repeatability.
